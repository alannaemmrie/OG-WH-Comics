A website for a small business to buy/sell comics, and interact with their customers. Built with HTML and CSS.

## Reflection
Project goals included learning and familiarizing myself with both HTML and CSS as well as the process of front-end web design.  The goals I was given from the business included straightforward navigation, ease in adding/removing comics from the catalog, and encouraging customer interaction.

I originally wanted to build a website where the business owner could most efficiently keep their catalog updated by editing the Publisher files (Marvel, DC, Romance, etc), with minimum knowledge of web development on their part. I chose to implement this by keeping the Publisher files as simply organized as possible, specifically by using CSS Flexbox and having a clear, cohesive format across all  site files.

This project was challenging for me because I was in the process of teaching myself HTML and CSS while I was building the site. The website underwent multiple versions as I became more proficient with these languages.  CSS Flexbox has been implemented in the latest (most current) version of the site.


## Progress
As mentioned above, this website is constantly being updated and changed according to the business owner's current catalog and comic events.  Future goals include teaching myself JavaScript so that the website can have a friendlier user interaction; examples of this include animation, a "checkout" cart, and smoother scrolling.

This website is currently a personal project, and is not looking for any other contributors.
